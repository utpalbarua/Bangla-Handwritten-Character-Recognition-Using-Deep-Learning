# Bangla Handwritten Character Recognition

---

## **Overview**
This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to recognize **handwritten Bangla characters** using the **BanglaLekha-Isolated dataset**.  
It classifies **84 characters** including vowels, consonants, and digits. The notebook covers data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of predictions with **Bangla labels**.

## **Dataset**
- **Name:** BanglaLekha-Isolated  
- **Source:** [Dataset](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340917301117?via%3Dihub)  
- Contains images of isolated handwritten Bangla characters.  
- Labels are mapped from **1â€“84**.
